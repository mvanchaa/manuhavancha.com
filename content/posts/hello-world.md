Hey there! 👋

I'm new to blogging and super excited (and a bit nervous 😅) to finally start this little space of mine on the internet. I’ve been meaning to do this for a while, and I’m happy to finally give it a go!

This blog will mostly be a mix of:

- 👩‍💻 My developer journey – what I’m building, breaking, and learning
- 💃 Random things I love – like dance, gardening, books, and more!

It won’t be perfect (and that’s okay). My goal is to write more, learn in public, and maybe even connect with people who relate to these things.

Thanks for stopping by. Let’s see where this goes 🌱✨

See you in the next post!
